# RAG System Training Guide

## üéØ Overview

This comprehensive guide covers how to train and improve your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using the implemented feedback and training infrastructure. The system learns from user interactions and continuously improves response quality.

## ‚úÖ Training System Features

### 1. **User Feedback Collection**
Every query response now includes an interactive feedback section:
- ‚≠ê **5-star rating system** for response quality
- üìù **Comment field** for specific improvement suggestions
- üéØ **"Better response" field** where users can provide correct answers
- üìä **Automatic tracking** with unique feedback IDs for audit purposes
- üîó **Role-based feedback** linked to user permissions

### 2. **Intelligent Response Improvement**
The system automatically enhances responses using training data:
- üß† **Real-time lookup** - matches queries to known good responses
- ‚ú® **Auto-improvement indicator** - shows when responses are enhanced
- üìà **Confidence scoring** - only applies improvements with >80% confidence
- üîÑ **Seamless integration** - works with existing query pipeline

### 3. **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**
Full training management through the web interface:
- üìä **Training statistics** - feedback counts, quality metrics, ratings
- üîÑ **Process feedback** - convert user feedback into training data
- üì§ **Export training data** - JSONL/CSV formats for external fine-tuning
- üéØ **Quality filtering** - export only high-quality examples (>3.0 rating)
- üí° **Best practices guide** - training tips and recommendations

## üöÄ How to Train Your RAG System

### Method 1: User-Driven Training (Easiest)

**Users naturally train the system through normal usage:**

1. **Ask a question** through the web interface
2. **Rate the response** using the 5-star system
3. **Provide feedback** in the comment field
4. **Suggest improvements** in the "Better response" field (optional)
5. **Click Submit Feedback** - system learns automatically

**Example Training Scenario:**
```
Query: "How do I reset my password?"
Response: "Contact your administrator."
User Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)
Feedback: "This is not helpful. I need step-by-step instructions."
Better Response: "To reset your password: 1. Go to login page 2. Click 'Forgot Password' 3. Enter your email 4. Check your email for reset link 5. Follow the instructions"
```

**Result:** Next time someone asks about password reset, the system will use the improved response.

### Method 2: Admin-Managed Training (Powerful)

**Administrators manage training through the Admin Panel:**

#### **Step 1: Access Training Dashboard**
- Log in as admin user
- Navigate to **Admin Panel ‚Üí Training System**
- View current training statistics

#### **Step 2: Process Feedback**
- Click **"Process Feedback to Training Data"**
- System converts user feedback into training pairs
- High-rated responses (4-5 stars) become positive examples
- User corrections become high-quality training data
- Negative feedback generates improvement opportunities

#### **Step 3: Monitor Progress**
- **Feedback Statistics**: Total feedback, average ratings, positive/negative counts
- **Training Data**: Total training pairs, average quality score, data sources
- **Real-time updates** of training progress

#### **Step 4: Export Training Data**
- Choose format: **JSONL** (for model fine-tuning) or **CSV** (for analysis)
- Set **minimum quality score** (recommend 3.0+)
- Click **"Export Training Data"**
- Get file path for external model training

### Method 3: Programmatic Training (Advanced)

**Add training data directly via code:**

```python
from src.feedback_trainer import RAGTrainer
from config.config import RAGConfig

# Initialize trainer
config = RAGConfig()
trainer = RAGTrainer(config)

# Add known good examples
trainer.create_synthetic_training_data(
    queries=[
        "What are the security policies?",
        "How do I upload documents?",
        "What file formats are supported?"
    ],
    responses=[
        "Our security policies include: 1. Multi-factor authentication required 2. Regular password changes 3. Role-based access control...",
        "To upload documents: 1. Navigate to Upload Document page 2. Click 'Choose a file' 3. Select your document 4. Choose appropriate category 5. Click 'Upload Document'",
        "Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, XLSX, PNG, JPG, JPEG. Maximum file size: 50MB."
    ]
)

# Manually collect specific feedback
feedback_id = trainer.collect_feedback(
    query="How does the RAG system work?",
    response="It combines retrieval and generation.",
    rating=5,
    feedback="Perfect technical explanation!",
    user_role="developer"
)

# Process all feedback into training data
processed = trainer.process_feedback_to_training_data()
print(f"Processed {processed} feedback entries")

# Export for model fine-tuning
output_file = trainer.export_training_data(format="jsonl", min_quality=4.0)
print(f"High-quality training data exported to: {output_file}")
```

## üéØ Training Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Quality-Based Training**
Focus on high-quality feedback for best results:
- **5-star responses**: Use as positive training examples
- **User corrections**: Treat as gold-standard responses
- **Detailed feedback**: Process comments for improvement hints
- **Role-specific training**: Different responses for different user types

### **Strategy 2: Domain-Specific Training**
Create specialized knowledge areas:
- **Technical queries**: Developer-focused responses
- **User guides**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Policy questions**: Official policy responses
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem-solution pairs

### **Strategy 3: Iterative Improvement**
Continuously refine the system:
- **Weekly processing**: Regular feedback processing sessions
- **Quality monitoring**: Track improvement metrics over time
- **A/B testing**: Compare original vs improved responses
- **User satisfaction**: Monitor rating trends

## üìà Training Workflow Examples

### **Example 1: Improving Vague Responses**

**Before Training:**
```
Query: "How do I upload a document?"
Response: "Use the upload feature in the web interface."
User Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (2/5)
Feedback: "Too vague. Need detailed steps."
```

**After Processing:**
```
Training Pair Created:
Input: "Question: How do I upload a document?"
Output: "To upload a document: 1. Go to the 'Upload Document' page 2. Click 'Choose a file' 3. Select your document 4. Choose the appropriate category 5. Click 'Upload Document' 6. Wait for processing to complete"
Quality Score: 5.0 (from user correction)
```

**Result:** Future upload questions get detailed step-by-step responses.

### **Example 2: Enhancing Technical Accuracy**

**Before Training:**
```
Query: "What file formats are supported?"
Response: "We support common document formats."
User Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)
Feedback: "Need specific formats and size limits."
Better Response: "Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, XLSX, PNG, JPG, JPEG. Maximum file size: 50MB per document."
```

**After Processing:**
```
Training Pair Created:
Input: "Question: What file formats are supported?"
Output: "Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, XLSX, PNG, JPG, JPEG. Maximum file size: 50MB per document."
Quality Score: 5.0 (user correction)
```

**Result:** Technical questions get specific, accurate responses.

### **For Administrators**
1. **Process feedback regularly** - Weekly or monthly processing sessions
2. **Monitor quality trends** - Track average ratings over time
3. **Export high-quality data** - Use 4.0+ rating threshold for model training
4. **Review negative feedback** - Learn from poor responses
5. **Create synthetic examples** - Add known good responses programmatically

### **For Developers**
1. **Use structured training data** - Follow JSONL format for model training
