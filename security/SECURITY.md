## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the RAG System, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@your-domain.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide updates on the fix.

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for document access
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection
- All sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Secrets never logged or exposed in responses
- Document access filtered by user roles
- Audit logging for all access attempts

### API Security
- Rate limiting per role
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for production
- HTTPS enforcement via Nginx

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker containers run as non-root users
- Minimal container images
- Network isolation between services
- Regular security updates

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   ```bash
   # Use git-secrets or similar tools
   git secrets --scan
   ```

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip-audit
   pip-audit --fix
   ```

3. **Run security scans before commits**
   ```bash
   bandit -r src/
   safety check
   ```

### For Operators

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use strong JWT secrets (minimum 64 characters)
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use environment-specific configurations

2. **Network Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure firewall rules appropriately
   - Use VPN for administrative access

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor authentication failures
   - Track API usage patterns
   - Review audit logs regularly

4. **Updates**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Monitor security advisories

## Common Security Issues and Fixes

### 1. Weak JWT Secret
**Issue**: Using default or weak JWT secret
**Fix**: Generate strong secret:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 64
```

### 2. Exposed Sensitive Data
**Issue**: Sensitive data in logs
**Fix**: Use structured logging with data masking

### 3. Insufficient Rate Limiting
**Issue**: API abuse possible
**Fix**: Configure appropriate rate limits in `config/roles.py`

### 4. Outdated Dependencies
**Issue**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
**Fix**: Regular updates:
```bash
pip-audit --fix
safety check --full-report
```

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Strong JWT secret configured
- [ ] All default passwords changed
- [ ] HTTPS configured and enforced
- [ ] Firewall rules configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Incident response plan ready
- [ ] Security monitoring active
- [ ] Dependencies up to date

## Security Tools

### Automated Scanning
- **pip-audit**: Python dependency vulnerabilities
- **safety**: Security database checks
- **bandit**: Python code security issues
- **gitleaks**: Secret detection in code

### Manual Review
- Code review for security issues
- Penetration testing
- Security architecture review

## Incident Response

1. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notify**: Inform affected users if needed
4. **Remediate**: Fix vulnerability
5. **Document**: Record lessons learned
